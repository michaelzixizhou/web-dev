# web-dev

# HELLO TO ANYONE READING THIS!
This will be my first web development template project, and I hope to figure out the Django framwork from this.

I will be using VSCode, venv, and pip to build my virtual environment.

This is just a testing "playground", so to speak.

# UPDATE
As of now, this project is complete and I'll be moving onto making a fully fleshed-out web application for my personal website.
